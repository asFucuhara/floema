## The project
### There are countless advantages to creating websites from scratch without using JavaScript frameworks such as React, Vue, or Angular. Especially when you want to create something unique that has never been done before on any other website.
In this course, you'll learn how to set up your own boilerplate from scratch with all the technologies, tools, and libraries you need to get up to speed.

More Info

We’ll teach you the right approach to using plain JavaScript in a website: we’ll cover Fetch API and History API, then integrate it with ECMAScript 2015+ classes that will use Promises to animate in and animate out your views in a seamless way.


We’ll also learn how to construct reusable component classes that can speed up your development process. Finally, we’ll learn how to integrate the plain JavaScript setup with animation-focused libraries such as GSAP, OGL, and Three.js, making your website stand out from all the rest.

By the end of this course, you’ll be able to create a top-notch website, learn some Front End technologies and tools such as Pug (Template Engine), SASS/SCSS + PostCSS (CSS Preprocessor), Babel (ECMAScript 2015+ JavaScript compiler), and Webpack (Assets Bundler) and finally learn how to integrate everything with industry-standard libraries like GSAP, OGL and Three.js to enhance your website even more.
